        <h3 id="forms">Forms</h3>
        <p>Forms are made up of elements such as input fields, select menus and buttons.</p>
        <p>The data entered into forms was traditionally sent and processed to a backend language like PHP or Ruby. It is possible now to process the information on the from end before sending it to the server using JS.</p>
        <p>When building a form the designer/creator must have design principles at the forefront of their mind. Your form must give the user a good experience.</p>
        <p><a href="search.html">Searching Example</a></p>
        <p>form.reset() will reset all the form controls back to their initial values.</p>
        <pre>
                <button type='reset'>Reset</button>
        </pre>
        <p>This is not the best idea for user experience. The button can be easily pushed and the form entries lost.</p>
        <p>The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute, so it's sent to a different URL for processing</p>
        <p>example: form.action = '/an/other.url'</p>
        <hr>

        <h4>Form Events</h4>
        <p>Some of the events that forms are able to trigger are exclusive to forms.</p>
        <p>The focus event occurs when an element is focused on.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                const input = form.elements.searchInput;
                input.addEventListener('focus', () => alert('focused'), false); 
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>When the cursor is placed inside the the element (input) either by clicking or navigating to it on the keyboard it will show the message 'focused' on the screen.</p>
        <p>When the cursor is placed in the input field the message should appear.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Submitting a Form</h4>
        <p>A submit event occurs when a form is submitted.</p>
        <p>The content of the form is usually sent to the server to be processed but Javascript can be used to intercept the form before it is sent.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                const form = document.forms['search'];
                form.addEventListener ('submit', search, false);
                
                function search() {
                    alert('Form Submitted');
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>When the submit button is clicked a message appears which says 'Form Submitted.</p>
        <p>When we use the preventDefault() method it stops the form from being submitted to the URL.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                function search(event) {
                    alert('Form Submitted');
                    event.preventDefault();
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>When an attempt is made to submit the form the message still appears but the form does not try and submit itself to the dummy URL.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Retrieving and Changing Values From a Form</h4>
        <p>The value property within an input element can be sued to retrieve text inside the field.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                function search(event) {
                    alert(`You Searched for: ${input.value}`);
                    event.preventDefault();
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Input is the variable that points to the input element in the form.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Form Controls</h4>
        <h5>Common Types of Form Control</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>input</li>
            <li>select</li>
            <li>textarea</li>
            <li>button</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="hero.html">Form Example using these elements</a></p>
        <h5>Other Types of Form Controls</h5>
        <h5>Input Fields</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Text Input Fields - used for short text (username etc) - type='text'</li>
            <li>Password Input Fields - used to enter passwords or secret information - type='password'</li>
            <li>Checkbox Input Fields - used to select different options at the same time - type='checkbox'</li>
            <li>Radio Button Input Fields - only one of the options shown can be selected - type='radio'</li>
            <li>Hidden Input Fields - not displayed by the browser but is given a value - submitted with the form - type='hidden'</li>
            <li>File Input Types - used for uploading files - type='file'</li>
            <li>Other Input Types - number, tel, color</li>
            <li>Select Drop-Down List - a drop down list which can allow for more than one option to be selected - select and option</li>
            <li>Text Areas - a textarea element is used to enter a block of text - textarea is the element name.</li>
            <li>Buttons - Default type is submit. Reset is also an option which deletes the content of the inputs of the form. Button is the other type - not attached to anything and can be standalone.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Form Validation</h5>
        <p>This goes through the form and checks to make sure everything is correct.</p>
        <p>The types of validation are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A require field - check that it has been completed</li>
            <li>An email address - check that what has been enetered is a valid format</li>
            <li>A number - check that the content is only numeric</li>
            <li>A password - check that the rules that have been set for a password has been followed</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These items can be added using HTML but there is also a way of implementing validation using Javascript.</p>
        <p>This way of validation is not standard so you would have to make up your own rules.</p>

        <h5>Instant Feedback</h5>
        <p>Instant feedback improves userbility. Event listeners can be added directly to the input field and it will fire when the user presses a key.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3 id="OOP">Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>The three main concepts in OOP are: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.</p>
        <h5>Encapsulation</h5>
        <p>The inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user.</p>
        <h5>Polymorphism</h5>
        <p>The same process can be used on for different objects. In OOP various objects can share the same method but can also override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p>
        <h5>Inheritance</h5>
        <p>This takes an object that already exists and inherits all of its properties and methods.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Classes</h4>
        <p>The juicer class would represent the design of the juicer, and each juicer that’s made on the production line would be instances of that class.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Constructor Functions</h4>
        <pre>
    <code>
        const Dice = function(sides=6){
            this.sides = sides;
            this.roll = function() {
                return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
            }
        }
    </code>
</pre>
        <hr>
        <h4>Static Methods</h4>
        <p>These can be used in class declarationns to create a static method or class methods. A static method is called by the class rather than by instances of the class.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                class Dice {
                    constructor(sides=6) {
                        this.sides = sides;
                    }
                    roll() {
                        return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
                    }
                    static description() {
                        return 'A way of choosing random numbers'
                    }
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>This method is called from the Dice class - Dice.description()</p>
        <p>Static methods are not available to instances of the class. So, in our example, the instances of Dice such as redDice and blueDice cannot call the static description() method: </p>
        <p>redDice.description</p>
        <p>>><i>TypeError: red.description is not a function</i></p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Getters & Setters</h4>
        <pre>
    <code>
        me.age = 21;
        me.retirementAge = 65;
        Object.defineProperty(me, 'yearsToRetirement',{
            get() {
                if(this.age > this.retirementAge) { return 0; }
                else { return this.retirementAge - this.age; }
            },
            set(value) {
                this.age = this.retirementAge - value;
                return value;
            }
        });
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>if we add age and retirementAge properties to the me object, we can then create a yearsToRetirement property that depends on these properties</p>
        <p>The get() and set() methods can be used to control how a property is set using assignment and the value that is returned when a property is queried.</p>
        <p>The getter bases the yearsToRetirement property on the age and retirementAge properties</p>
        <p>me.yearsToRetirement</p>
        <p> >> 44</p>
        <p>The setter also allows the age to be changed by setting the yearsToRetirement property:</p>
        <p>me.yearsToRetirement = 10;</p>
        <p> >> 10</p>
        <p>me.age</p>
        <p> >> 55</p>

        <h4>MVC Frameworks - Model-View-Controller</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Models - objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information about the application, as well as any other associated logic and behavior</li>
            <li>Views - provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information</li>
            <li>Controllers - link models and views together by communicating between them</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="MVC/list.html">MVC Example</a></p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Frameworks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Aurelia is a modern framework that uses ES6, and focuses on letting you write dynamic web applications while keeping the implementation details in the background.</li>
            <li>Angularis a powerful framework by Google to make creating dynamic web applications easier. This is done by extending the HTML language using custom ng- attributes.</li>
            <li>Emberis a framework designed to make building large web applications easier. It does this by using common conventions that avoid the need for lots of set-up code, though it can become more difficult if you don’t follow these conventions.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>Templates</h4>
        <p>Templating languages allow HTML to be separated from the JavaScript program.</p>
        <p>Templating languages often have a mechanism for inserting dynamic data into the HTML.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Handlebars</li>
            <li>Pug</li>
            <li>EJS</li>
            <li>Mustache</li>
            <li>Nunjucks</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>View Libraries</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>Vue</li>
            <li>Svelte</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>Webpack</h4>
        <p>Webpack is a module bundler that takes all the JavaScript files used in your project and bundles them altogether in one file.</p>
        <p>This also allows you to perform tasks such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transpiling code</li>
            <li>Minifying Code</li>
            <li>Linting Code</li>
            <li>Testing Code</li>
            <li>Compiling CSS preprocessor files (such as Sass, Less or Stylus) into standard CSS files.</li>
        </ul>
